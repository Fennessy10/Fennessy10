## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Patrick Fennessy, and I'm a IT student majoring in Software Engineering interested in all things programming

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Hollow Train, a game I am making in Unity using C#
- ðŸŒ± I recently built a [BlackJack Game](https://blackjack-v7lr.onrender.com/) using a MongoDB database to store current scores and highscores for players across multiple playing sessions
