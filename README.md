## Hi 👋

My name is Patrick Fennessy, and I'm a IT student majoring in Software Engineering interested in all things programming

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Hollow Train, a game I am making in Unity using C# (currently privated)
- 🌱 I recently built a [BlackJack Game](https://blackjack-v7lr.onrender.com/) in Node.js - JavaScript, using a MongoDB database to store current scores and highscores for players across multiple playing sessions
